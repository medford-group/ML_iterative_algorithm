## ML_iterative_algorithm
This repository includes the developed machine-learning algorihms and re-ordered Coulomb matrix.
Each folder has the scripts and an example.
* ML algorithm
This algorithm iteratively finds the valuable training data from test set.
This algorithm was further used to predicting the phase diagrams.
* Re-ordered Coulomb matrix
The coulomb matrix only works for the molecules.

##### Note
* If using the script to predict the adsorption energy, you need to change some values, such as x-ticks and y-ticks.
* Other parameters have been introduced in the scripts, accordingly, some parameters should be chaged when useing it.
