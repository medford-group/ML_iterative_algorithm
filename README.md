## ML_iterative_algorithm
This repository includes the developed machine-learning algorihms and re-ordered Coulomb matrix.
Each folder has the scripts and an example.
* ML algorithm
This algorithm iteratively finds the valuable training data from test set.
This algorithm was further used to predicting the phase diagrams.
* Re-ordered Coulomb matrix
The coulomb matrix only works for the molecules.

##### Note
* The parameters have been introduced in the scripts, accordingly, some parameters should be chaged when using it.
